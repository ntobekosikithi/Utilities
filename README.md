Overview
The Utilities package contains frequently used code patterns, extensions, and helper classes that are commonly needed across iOS projects. This package follows the principle of "write once, use everywhere" and promotes code reusability.
Why Create a Utilities Package?
✅ Reasons TO Create a Utilities Package:
1. Code Reusability

Eliminates duplicate code across projects
Provides battle-tested implementations of common functionality
Reduces development time for new projects

2. Consistency

Ensures consistent implementation of common patterns across your codebase
Standardizes naming conventions and API design
Maintains uniform behavior for similar operations

3. Maintainability

Centralizes bug fixes and improvements
Makes it easier to update functionality across multiple projects
Reduces technical debt by having a single source of truth

4. Testing

Utilities can be thoroughly tested in isolation
Provides confidence that common functionality works correctly
Reduces the need to test the same utility functions in multiple projects

5. Team Productivity

New team members can quickly access common functionality
Reduces onboarding time
Provides documented, standardized solutions

6. Separation of Concerns

Keeps utility code separate from business logic
Makes main project code cleaner and more focused
Easier to reason about core app functionality

❌ Reasons NOT TO Create a Utilities Package:
1. Over-Engineering

Can lead to premature abstraction
Might create complexity where simple, inline solutions would suffice
Risk of building features that are never actually needed

2. Coupling Issues

Can create tight coupling between projects and the utilities package
Makes it harder to modify utilities without affecting multiple projects
Dependency management complexity

3. Versioning Complexity

Need to manage package versions across multiple projects
Breaking changes in utilities can affect multiple projects
Coordination required when updating utilities
